# Interview finalizing e-mail

Dear ___,

Thank you for wanting to participate in our study on data fabrication. I have received your suggested interview times and would like to confirm the face-to-face interview on DATE at TIME at ADDRESS.
<!-- If unclear address, make sure to ask for specification -->

Please bring the filled out spreadsheet to the interview, either on a USB stick or on your computer. If the spreadsheet needs to be transferred from your computer, we will supply a USB stick to transfer the file. We encourage you to keep notes about how you fabricated the data, in order to facilitate the face-to-face interview. 

If you would like to redownload the materials, find the spreadsheet [here](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/ELp70g71Y7bosCW) and the instructions [here](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/mMDkgCILKU8rhhD).
<!-- Need to add these with Surfdrive links (to prevent them from getting onto the Github page immediately) -->

Kind regards,
Jan Voelkel
