We require you to fabricate data for 25 participants in a Stroop task experiment. 

The goal is to fabricate data that look as genuine as possible.
 
## Stroop task

In the Stroop task, participants are asked to determine the color a word is presented in (i.e., word colors), but the word also reads a color (i.e., color words). The presented word color (i.e., 'red', 'blue', or 'green') can be either presented in the congruent color (e.g., 'red' presented in red) or an incongruent color (i.e., 'red' presented in green). The dependent variable in the Stroop task is the response latency. It is hypothesized that latency is on average higher for incongruent than for congruent words.

## Hypothesis

Your task is to confirm the existence of a Stroop effect with fabricated data, while attempting to cover up the data fabrication by making them look as genuine as possible. In other words, the hypothesis is that there is an effect of congruency on the response latencies in the Stroop task, such that responses in the incongruent condition are on average slower than in the congruent condition.

## Fabrication instructions

We require you to fabricate both the mean and standard deviation of the response latencies of 25 (fictional) individuals, in both congruent and incongruent conditions (i.e., 25 individuals × 2 conditions × 2 statistics = 100 data points). Each participant sees 30 trials of the Stroop task in the congruent condition, and 30 trials in the incongruent condition. 

At the bottom of this page, a link is provided to a spreadsheet in which you have to fill out your fabricated data. 

Your task is to fabricate the mean and standard deviation of the response latencies in milliseconds (i.e., 1 second = 1,000 milliseconds) for each person for both the congruent condition and the incongruent condition. How you decide to fabricate these data is fully in your own hands. 

The green columns in the spreadsheet depict where you have to fill in the means of the congruent response latencies and their standard deviations. 

The yellow columns in the spreadsheet depict the corresponding statistics for incongruent response latencies. 

Each row depicts the data for one participant. 

The spreadsheet automatically calculates and displays the test statistic (t-value and p-value) concerning the within-person difference of the conditions (i.e., the Stroop effect). How you decide to fabricate the results that you fill out in the spreadsheet is up to you. Your task is to fabricate means and standard deviations such that the mean *congruent* response latency is lower than the mean *incongruent* response latency.

**You can spend as much time as you think is needed on fabricating the data, until the face-to-face interview takes place. This does not need to be done within this browser window.**

## Scheduling the face-to-face interview

Now, we would like to request you to plan an interview with research assistant Jan Voelkel.

In order to facilitate the planning of the face-to-face interviews throughout the Netherlands and Belgium, we would like to ask you to suggest several options (at least three) below and the address where the interview would take place. Note that you can choose the address as long as it is within Belgium or the Netherlands.

Multiple suggestions are a necessity because travel time by public transport has to be taken into account. In the case that the suggestions are not physically possible for Jan Voelkel, he will contact you to try and reschedule.

Please answer the following questions to schedule the interview.

Please select the days on which you are available for the interview (at least 3).

You can select the specific time when you are available and the location where the interview should be conducted on the next pages.

## E-mail address

Now, please indicate your e-mail address that we need to contact you for scheduling the interview. Your e-mail address will be deleted as soon as possible so that it cannot be matched with your data.

## End of survey message

Thank you very much for wanting to participate in our study. We will finalize the scheduling of the interview as soon as possible. You are free to work on fabricating the Stroop data until the face-to-face interview takes place.

As a reminder, we would like to note that fabricating data is only allowed within this experiment and should not be taken as an invitation to fabricate research results elsewhere. Data fabrication is a serious form of scientific misconduct and is widely and explicitly condemned by professional organizations, institutions, and funding agencies alike.

If there are any remaining questions about this study, feel free to e-mail Chris Hartgerink ([c.h.j.hartgerink@tilburguniversity.edu](mailto:c.h.j.hartgerink@tilburguniversity.edu)) or to call him (+31134664126).

You can close this window now.
