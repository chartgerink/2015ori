# Consent to Participate in Research

## Description
If you choose to participate, you will take part in a study about "Validating statistical methods to detect (potential) data fabrication". This study investigates faked research results, as they are usually reported in research papers (e.g., statistical test results). We focus on studying whether faked data can be detected with statistical methods and how valid these methods are in detecting (potentially) problematic data (e.g., the power and the false positive rate). The goal is to become better informed about the validity of these methods and whether these methods are valuable in practice.

## Benefits
Upon completion of the study, you can choose to receive an Amazon gift card ($XX) at the e-mail of your choosing. This gift card will be sent to you on the completion date of the study (i.e., XX XXXX, 2015). The faked research results that were hardest to detect and provided an e-mail, will receive an additional $XXX gift card.

## Risks/Discomforts
There is a small risk that you may become uncomfortable during the study. If at any point during the study proceedings you become uncomfortable, you may elect to withdraw your consent to participate without consequences to you. To withdraw your consent, simply close this browser window. If any feelings of discomfort emerge you are free to contact the lead investigator with any questions or concerns using the email address listed at the bottom of this consent form. While there is a small chance that the confidentiality of the information collected could be compromised, we will take care to prevent this from happening. This study has been approved by the Tilburg University Psychological Ethics Committee.

## Confidentiality
Your contact information is only used to send an invitation e-mail and will not be connected to your responses. After sending out the Amazon gift cards, all e-mail addresses are permanently deleted. To ensure anonymity, we disabled the logging of your e-mail address or IP-address by Qualtrics when responding to the survey. The data from this study will be made publicly available at the Open Science Framework for as long as possible, such that other researchers can verify and reanalyze the data.

## Voluntary Nature of Participation
Your decision to participate in this study is completely voluntary. Thus, you may refuse to join the study or terminate your participation at any time without negative consequences. Should you wish to terminate your participation at any point, you only need to close the browser window.
