# Invitation email

Dear fellow scientist,

We are developing and validating statistical methods to detect data fabrication by researchers who lack scientific integrity. We are currently studying the performance of such statistical methods to distinguish genuine from fabricated data using the Stroop task. To this end, we are looking for honest scientists from Belgium and the Netherlands who have published on the Stroop task and want to participate in our study. We retrieved your email from the "Web of Science" database, which we searched for articles on the Stroop task. If you are not currently a resident of Belgium/the Netherlands, our apologies for e-mailing you and you can discard this message. 

We would like to invite you, as an honest scientist, to participate in our current study on the performance of statistical methods to distinguish genuine psychological data from fabricated data using the Stroop task. In this study, we request you to fabricate a dataset on the Stroop task (means and standard deviations of response latency for 25 participants in two conditions each). We would also like to conduct a face-to-face interview on how you fabricated the data, in order to get a qualitative understanding of how researchers might fabricate data. 

As such, participation would entail fabricating a dataset before the face-to-face interview. Fabricating the data will probably take at least 30 minutes; the face-to-face interview will take approximately 45 minutes.

To compensate you for your participation, you will receive 100 euros by bank transfer after the end of the interview. You may earn an additional 100 euros if your fabricated results prove to be one of the three that are hardest to detect (out of 20). 

The data of our study will only be used to examine the performance of statistical methods to detect fabricated data. Our study has been approved by the Psychological Ethics Committee of Tilburg University (reference EC-2015.50) and is funded by the Office of Research Integrity from the United States.

Participation in this study requires the use of a PC and a spreadsheet program such as Excel or OpenOffice, because we require you to use spreadsheets to process the fabricated data.
