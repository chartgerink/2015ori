# Invitation email

Dear fellow scientist,

We are conducting a study on statistical methods to distinguish genuine psychological data from fabricated data (using the Stroop task). To this end, we are looking for scientists from the Netherlands and Belgium who have published on the Stroop task and want to participate in our study. We retrieved your email from the "Web of Science" database. If you are not currently a resident of the Netherlands/Belgium, our apologies for e-mailing you and you can discard this message. 

We would like to invite you to participate in this study, where we request you to fabricate a dataset on the Stroop task and would like to conduct a face-to-face interview on how you fabricated the data. To compensate you for your time, you will receive 100 euros at the end of the interview. You may earn an additional 100 euros if your fabricated results prove to be one of the three that are hardest to detect (out of 20). Participation would entail fabricating a dataset before the face-to-face interview. The face-to-face interview will take approximately 45 minutes, fabricating the data will take at least 30 minutes but the time spent on fabricating data is at your discretion.

The data of our study will only be used to examine the performance of statistical methods to detect fabricated data. Our study has been approved by the Psychological Ethics Committee of Tilburg University (reference EC-2015.50).

Participation in this study requires the use of a PC, because we require you to use spreadsheets to process the fabricated data.
