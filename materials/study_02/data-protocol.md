# Step-by-step protocol for handing over data from Jan to Chris 

## Data
- Spreadsheet with fabricated data
- Interview recordings

## Tasks
- We have to be able to link spreadsheet and interview recordings
- We have to store the data
- All identifiable information have to be deleted

## Problems
- Do we want to store the initial recordings of the interviews or only the transcripts?
- We need the identifiable information so that we can send the 100â‚¬ to the winner

## Procedure

After Interview starting situation:
- 20 spreadsheets are on a USB stick with response-id
- 20 interview recordings are on the Dictaphone with response-id
- 20 unidentifiable receipts for 100 euros
- 20 identifiable receipts for bonus of 100 euros (temporary link)

### Processing these materials

1. Jan separates unidentifiable and identifiable parts of receipts
2. Jan copy-pastes from each spreadsheet rows 8-33 into a text file. Save the text file as `ID.txt`
3. Jan hands over unidentifiable receipts and `ID.txt` files to Chris (Chris checks and uploads `ID.txt` to Github)
4. Chris analyzes the data and identifies the three IDs that were hardest to detect
5. Chris sends Jan the IDs, Jan gives the bank information to send the bonus to and sends participants an email that they will receive a bonus.
6. Jan destroys identifying part of receipt.
7. Jan uses [oTranscribe](http://otranscribe.com/) to transcribe interviews
8. Jan sends transcripts to Chris; Chris uploads transcripts to Github after checking for potential identifiability in text
9. Jan hands over encrypted USB with all information (original spreadsheets, raw audio recordings) to Chris (Chris cannot access files)
10. Chris wipes USB drive (overwrite with zeroes multiple times), to ensure removal of data.
