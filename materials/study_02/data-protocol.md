# Step-by-step protocol for handing over data from Jan to Chris 

## Data
- Spreadsheet with fabricated data
- Interview recordings

## Tasks
- We have to be able to link spreadsheet and interview recordings
- We have to store the data
- All identifiable information have to be deleted

## Problems
- Do we want to store the initial recordings of the interviews or only the transcripts?
- We need the identifiable information so that we can send the 100â‚¬ to the winner

## Instruments needed
- 4 USB sticks (transfer stick, spreadsheet stick, interview stick, ???)

## Procedure

### Getting spreadsheets from participants (During interview)

1. Jan gives empty USB stick (transfer stick) to participant.
2. Participant copies their spreadsheet to the transfer stick.

### Assigning IDs (After each interview, but before the next)

1. Jan copies spreadsheet from transfer stick to spreadsheet stick.
2. Jan assigns ID to spreadsheet (names file ID.xls).
3. Jan deletes spreadsheet from transfer stick.
4. Jan copies interview from dictaphone to interview stick.
5. Jan assigns ID to interview (names file ID.dataFormat).
6. Jan deletes interview from dictaphone.

### Materials after all interviews are conducted

- 20 spreadsheets are on a USB stick with response-id
- 20 interview recordings are on the Dictaphone with response-id
- 20 unidentifiable receipts for 100 euros
- 20 identifiable receipts for bonus of 100 euros (temporary link)

### Processing these materials

1. Jan separates unidentifiable and identifiable parts of receipts
2. Jan copy-pastes from each spreadsheet rows 8-33 into a text file. Save the text file as `ID.txt`
3. Jan hands over unidentifiable receipts and `ID.txt` files to Chris (Chris checks and uploads `ID.txt` to Github)
4. Chris analyzes the data and identifies the three IDs that were hardest to detect
5. Chris sends Jan the IDs, Jan gives the bank information to send the bonus to.
6. Jan destroys identifying part of receipt.
7. Jan uses [oTranscribe](http://otranscribe.com/) to transcribe interviews
8. Jan sends transcripts to Chris; Chris uploads transcripts to Github after checking for potential identifiability in text
9. Jan hands over encrypted USB with all information (original spreadsheets, raw audio recordings) to Chris (Chris cannot access files)
10. Chris wipes USB drive (overwrite with zeroes multiple times), to ensure removal of data.
