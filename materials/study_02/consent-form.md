## Description

If you choose to participate, you will take part in a study on distinguishing genuine from fabricated data. You will be asked to fabricate research data on the Stroop task and to be interviewed about how you fabricated the data.

## Benefits

You will receive 100 euros approximately 4-6 weeks after the face-to-face interview, with an additional 100 euros if your fabricated results are one of the three that are hardest to detect (out of 20).

Your participation will help us investigate the performance of statistical methods to detect fabricated data. We focus on studying the statistical properties (e.g., the power and the false positive rate) of methods to detect data fabrication, where the goal is to examine whether these statistical methods are valuable to apply in practice.

## Risks/discomforts

Fabricating the data will probably take at least 30 minutes. The face-to-face interview will take approximately 45 minutes and will be audio-recorded. You may become uncomfortable during the study given the unethical nature of fabricating data in this controlled setting. If any feelings of discomfort emerge you are free to contact the principal investigator with any questions or concerns using the email address listed at the bottom of this consent form. This study has been approved by the Tilburg University Psychological Ethics Committee (reference EC-2015.50) and is funded by the US Office of Research Integrity.

## Confidentiality

No information about you is collected within the Qualtrics environment (e.g., IP address). We are required by law to have receipts that you, the participant, has received the reward at the end of the study. These receipts are temporarily linked to the responses in order to identify the participants who fabricated results that are hardest to detect (top three out of 20). These temporary links are permanently removed after the rewards are awarded. The audio-recording of the interview will be transcribed and deleted, except for one randomly chosen recording (for verification purposes; this is stored on an encrypted drive and stored for 10 years). The unlinked, anonymous data and transcripts from this study will be made publicly available at the Open Science Framework for as long as possible.

## Voluntary nature of participation

Your decision to participate in this study is completely voluntary. If you choose to participate, you may terminate your participation at any time. Due to limited resources, we can only reward participants who complete the study.

## Contact information

In case you have any remaining concerns or questions about this survey, please feel free to e-mail the principal investigator Chris Hartgerink ([c.h.j.hartgerink@tilburguniversity.edu](mailto:c.h.j.hartgerink@tilburguniversity.edu)).
