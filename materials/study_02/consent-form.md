## Description

If you choose to participate, you will take part in a study about "Validating statistical methods to detect (potential) data fabrication". If you participate, you will be asked to fabricate research results of the Stroop task and be interviewed about how you fabricated the interview.

## Benefits

You will receive 100 euros 2-4 weeks after the end of the face-to-face interview, with a potential additional 100 euros if your fabricated results are one of the three that are hardest to detect (out of 20).

Your participation will help us investigate the performance of statistical methods to detect fabricated data. We focus on studying the statistical properties (e.g., the power and the false positive rate) of methods to detect data fabrication, where the goal is to examine whether these statistical methods are valuable to apply in practice.

## Risks/discomforts

Fabricating the data will take at least 30 minutes, but how long you spend on it is at your discretion. The face-to-face interview will take approximately 45 minutes and will be audio-recorded. There is a small risk that you may become uncomfortable during the study given the unethical nature of the behavior that we request you to perform in this controlled setting. If any feelings of discomfort emerge you are free to contact the lead investigator with any questions or concerns using the email address listed at the bottom of this consent form. This study has been approved by the Tilburg University Psychological Ethics Committee (reference EC-2015.50).

## Confidentiality

To ensure anonymity, we disabled the logging of your e-mail address or IP-address by Qualtrics when responding to the invitation. We are required by law to have receipts that you, the participant has received the reward at the end of the study. These receipts are temporarily linked to the responses in order to identify the participants who fabricated results that are hardest to detect (top three out of 20). These temporary links are permanently removed after the rewards are awarded. The unlinked audio-recording of the interview will be stored on an encrypted drive only the PI and research assistant have access to. The unlinked, anonymous data and transcripts from this study will be made publicly available at the Open Science Framework for as long as possible, such that other researchers can verify and reanalyze the data.

## Voluntary nature of participation

Your decision to participate in this study is completely voluntary. If you choose to participate, you may terminate your participation at any time. Due to limited resources, we can only reward participants who complete the study.

## Contact information

In case you have any remaining concerns or questions about this survey, please feel free to e-mail the principal investigator Chris Hartgerink ([c.h.j.hartgerink@tilburguniversity.edu](mailto:c.h.j.hartgerink@tilburguniversity.edu)).
