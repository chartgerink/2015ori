If any feelings of \ndiscomfort emerge you are free to contact the principal investigator \nwith any questions or concerns using the email address or the phone \nnumber listed at the bottom of this consent form.

These receipts are temporarily linked to the responses in order to identify the participants who fabricated results that are hardest to detect (top three out of 20). All temporary links are permanently removed after the rewards are awarded. The audio-recording of the interview will be transcribed and deleted, except for one randomly chosen recording (for verification purposes; this is stored on an encrypted drive and stored for 10 years).
