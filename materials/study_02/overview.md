# Invitation email

NOTE: copied from [study 01 consent form and revised](https://github.com/chartgerink/2015ori/blob/master/materials/study_01/invitation_email.txt)

Dear fellow scientist,

We are conducting a study on statistical methods to distinguish genuine psychological data from fabricated data. To this end, we are looking for scientists who have recently published on the Stroop task and want to participate in our study.

NOTE: This study is **not** about testing your published studies for fabrication.

We would like to invite you to participate in this study, where we request you to fabricate a dataset on the Stroop task and would like to interview you on how you fabricated the data. To compensate you for your time, you will receive 100 euro's at the end of the interview. You may earn an additional 100 euro's if your fabricated results prove to be one of the three that are hardest to detect (out of 20). Participation would entail fabricating a dataset before the face-to-face interview. The face-to-face interview will take approximately 45 minutes, fabricating the data will take at least 30 minutes but the time spent on fabricating data is at your discretion.

The data of our study will be used to examine the performance of statistical methods to detect fabricated data. This study has been approved by the Psychological Ethics Committee of Tilburg University (reference EC-2015.50).

Participation in this study requires the use of a PC, because we require you to use spreadsheets to process the fabricated data.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reply to this e-mail.

Kind regards from Tilburg University,
Chris Hartgerink
Jan Völkel
Marcel van Assen

# Consent form

## Consent to Participate in Research

### Description

If you choose to participate, you will take part in a study about "Validating statistical methods to detect (potential) data fabrication". If you participate, you will be asked to fabricate research results. 

### Benefits

You will receive 100 euro's at the end of the face-to-face interview, with a potential additional 100 euro's if your fabricated results are one of the three that are hardest to detect (out of 20). 

Your participation will help us investigate the performance of statistical methods to detect fabricated data. We focus on studying whether fabricated data can be detected in a valid manner (e.g., the power and the false positive rate), where the goal is to become better informed about the validity of these methods and whether these methods are valuable to apply in practice.

### Risks/discomforts

Fabricating the data will take at least 30 minutes, but how long you spend on it is at your discretion. The face-to-face interview will take approximately 45 minutes. There is a small risk that you may become uncomfortable during the study given the unethical nature of the behavior that we request you to perform in this controlled setting. If any feelings of discomfort emerge you are free to contact the lead investigator with any questions or concerns using the email address listed at the bottom of this consent form. This study has been approved by the Tilburg University Psychological Ethics Committee (reference EC-2015.50).

### Confidentiality

To ensure anonymity, we disabled the logging of your e-mail address or IP-address by Qualtrics when responding to the invitation. We are required by law to have receipts that the participant has received the reward. These receipts are temporarily linked to the responses in order to identify the participants who fabricated results that are hardest to detect (top three out of 20). These temporary links are permanently removed after the rewards are awarded. The unlinked and anonymous data from this study will be made publicly available at the Open Science Framework for as long as possible, such that other researchers can verify and reanalyze the data.

### Voluntary nature of participation

Your decision to participate in this study is completely voluntary. If you choose to participate, you may terminate your participation at any time.

### Contact information

In case you have any remaining concerns or questions about this survey, please feel free to e-mail the principal investigator Chris Hartgerink ([c.h.j.hartgerink@tilburguniversity.edu](mailto:c.h.j.hartgerink@tilburguniversity.edu)).

### Consent

If you are willing to participate in this study and if you agree with the anonymization and storage of the data, please confirm below and continue with the survey.
 
 - [ ]	I have read and understood the description and consent to participate in this study and agree with the outlined anonymization procedure and data storage, knowing that I can stop my participation at any time.


# Instructions

## Overview study

We require you to fabricate data for 25 participants in a Stroop task experiment. The goal is to fabricata that look as genuine as possible. The fabricated data must support the two hypotheses that we provide.
 
In the Stroop task, participants are asked to determine the color a word is presented in (i.e., word colors), but the word also reads a color (i.e., color words). The presented word color (i.e., 'red', 'blue', or 'green') can be either presented in the congruent color (e.g., 'red' presented in red) or an incongruent color (i.e., 'red' presented in green). The dependent variable in the Stroop task is the response latency. It is hypothesized that latency is on average higher for incongruent than for congruent words.

We require you to fabricate the mean and standard deviation of 25 (fictional) individuals their response latencies in both congruent and incongruent conditions (i.e., 25 individuals × 2 conditions × 2 statistics = 100 data points). Each participant sees 30 trials of the Stroop task in the congruent condition, and 30 trials in the incongruent condition.
<!-- Need to double check that number with ML3 -->

## Hypotheses

Below, a link is provided to a spreadsheet in which you have to fill out your fabricated summary statistics for the Stroop effect study. A pdf of the instructions provided here is also available to download.

Your task is to fabricate the mean and SD of the response latency (in milliseconds; i.e., 1 second = 1000 milliseconds) for congruent and incongruent conditions, for 25 (fictional) individuals (i.e., 2 conditions × 2 statistics × 25 persons = 100 data points).

After you fill out the highlighted yellow cells, the spreadsheet automatically calculates and displays the test statistics (t-values and p-values) concerning one hypothesis. How you decide to fabricate the results that you fill out in the spreadsheet is up to you. Your task is to fabricate means and standard deviations such that
 
1. There is an effect of condition, such that responses in the incongruent condition are slower than in the congruent condition.

2. There are no differences in the standard deviations of responses across conditions. [CHJH: Marcel, you want to see evidence of this in ML3 again I guess? :-)]

# Fabrication spreadsheet

See this [spreadsheet](https://github.com/chartgerink/2015ori/raw/master/materials/study_02/templateUNLOCKED.xlsx).

# Schedule a meeting

On the previous screen, we provided you with the materials to participate in this study. You can spend as much time as you think is needed on fabricating the data, until the interview actually takes place.

Now, we would like to request you to plan an interview with the research assistant Jan. In order to facilitate the planning of the interviews throughout the Netherlands and Belgium, we would like to ask you to suggest several options in his calendar via Doodle.com with the address where the interview would take place. 

Multiple suggestions are a necessity, given travel time has to be taken into account. In the case that the suggestions are not physically possible for Jan, he will contact you to try and reschedule. 

# Interview questions

- How long do you estimate that it took you to fabricate the data?

- Did you apply a specific data fabrication strategy or did you experiment with whatever came to mind?

	- [if a specific strategy was used] Why did you choose for this specific strategy?

	- [if experimentation was used] What criteria did you use to determine if the data fabrication approach was successful?

- Were there things you spent particular focus on during the data fabrication in order to make them look more genuine?

	- [if yes] what aspects did you spend particular attention to?

	- [if no] in hindsight, are there things you think you should have paid specific attention to?
