Dear fellow scientist,

We are conducting a study on statistical methods to distinguish genuine psychological data from fabricated data. To this end, we are looking for scientists who have recently published on the Stroop task and want to participate in our study.
 
We would like to invite you to participate in this study, where we request you to fabricate a dataset on the Stroop task and would like to interview you on how you fabricated the data. To compensate you for your time, you will receive 100 euro's, with a potential additional 100 euro's if your fabricated results are one of the three that are hardest to detect (out of 20). Participation would entail fabricating a dataset before the interview on how the data were fabricated. The interview would take  approximately 45 minutes, fabricating the data at least 30 minutes but is not limited.

The data of our study will be used to examine the performance of statistical methods to detect fabricated data. This study has been approved by the Psychological Ethics Committee of Tilburg University (reference EC-2015.50).

Participation in this study requires the use of a PC, because we require you to use spreadsheets to process the fabricated data.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reply to this e-mail.

Kind regards from Tilburg University,
Chris Hartgerink
Jan Völkel
Marcel van Assen
Jelte Wicherts

# Consent form

## Consent to Participate in Research

### Description
If you choose to participate, you will take part in a study about "Validating statistical methods to detect (potential) data fabrication". If you participate, you will be asked to fake research results. 

### Benefits
You will receive 100 euro's, with a potential additional 100 euro's if your fabricated results are one of the three that are hardest to detect (out of 20).
In addition, we try to incrase scientific knowledge. Specifically, this study investigates faked research results, as they are usually reported in research papers (e.g., statistical test results). We focus on studying whether faked data can be detected with statistical methods and how valid these methods are in detecting (potentially) problematic data (e.g., the power and the false positive rate). The goal is to become better informed about the validity of these methods and whether these methods are valuable in practice.

### Risks/Discomforts
The interview would take approximately 45 minutes, fabricating the data at least 30 minutes but is not limited. There is a small risk that you may become uncomfortable during the study. If at any point during the study proceedings you become uncomfortable, you may elect to withdraw your consent to participate without consequences to you. If any feelings of discomfort emerge you are free to contact the lead investigator with any questions or concerns using the email address listed at the bottom of this consent form. While there is a small chance that the confidentiality of the information collected could be compromised, we will take care to prevent this from happening. This study has been approved by the Tilburg University Psychological Ethics Committee.

### Confidentiality
Your contact information is only used to send an invitation e-mail and will not be connected to your responses. After sending out the Amazon gift cards, all e-mail addresses are permanently deleted. To ensure anonymity, we disabled the logging of your e-mail address or IP-address by Qualtrics when responding to the survey. The data from this study will be made publicly available at the Open Science Framework for as long as possible, such that other researchers can verify and reanalyze the data.

### Voluntary Nature of Participation
Your decision to participate in this study is completely voluntary. Thus, you may refuse to join the study or terminate your participation at any time without negative consequences.

### Contact Information
In case you have any remaining concerns or questions about this survey, please feel free to e-mail one of the following persons: Chris Hartgerink (c.h.j.hartgerink@tilburguniversity.edu), Jelte Wicherts (j.m.wicherts@tilburguniversity.edu), or Marcel van Assen (m.a.l.m.vanassen@tilburgunviversity.edu)

### Consent
If you are willing to participate in this study and if you agree with the anonymization and storage of the data, please confirm below and continue with the survey.
 
[ ]	I have read and understood the description and consent to participate in this study and agree with the outlined anonymization procedure and data storage, knowing that I can stop my participation at any time.


# Instructions

## Overview study

We require you to fabricate summary statistics (means, standard deviations) that look as real as possible. Each fabricated set of summary statistics must support the hypothesis that we provide.

We request you to fabricate summary statistics of one study on the Stroop effect (Stroop, 1935). 
 
In the actual Stroop paradigm, participants are asked to determine the color a word is presented in (i.e., word colors), but the word also reads a color (i.e., color words). The presented word color (i.e., “red”, “blue”, or “green”) can be either presented in the congruent color (e.g., “red” presented in red) or an incongruent color (i.e., “red” presented in green). The dependent variable in the Stroop task is the response latency. It is hypothesized that latency is on average higher for incongruent than for congruent words.

Each participant fabricates the mean and SD of latency for congruent and incongruent conditions, for 25 (fictional) individuals (i.e., 2 conditions × 2 statistics × 25 persons = 100 data points).

Subsequently, we anonymously analyze these fabricated and genuine statistics and try to detect which statistics were fabricated and which were genuine.

Researchers who participate are compensated with €100. The three participants who fabricate the datasets that are the hardest to detect will get an additional reward of €100. In other words, if you are able to fool us with your fabricated statistics, you will receive a bonus.

## Hypotheses

Below, a link is provided to a spreadsheet in which you have to fill out your fabricated summary statistics for the Stroop effect study. 

Your task is to fabricate the mean and SD of latency for congruent and incongruent conditions, for 25 (fictional) individuals (i.e., 2 conditions × 2 statistics × 25 persons = 100 data points).

After you fill out the highlighted yellow cells, the spreadsheet automatically calculates and displays the test statistics (t-values and p-values) concerning one hypothesis. How you decide to fabricate the results that you fill out in the spreadsheet is up to you. Your task is to fabricate means and standard deviations such that
 
1. Latency is on average higher for incongruent than for congruent words
