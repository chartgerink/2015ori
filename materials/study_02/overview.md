# Invitation email

NOTE: copied from [study 01 consent form and revised](https://github.com/chartgerink/2015ori/blob/master/materials/study_01/invitation_email.txt)

Dear fellow scientist,

We are conducting a study on statistical methods to distinguish genuine psychological data from fabricated data. To this end, we are looking for scientists who have recently published on the Stroop task and want to participate in our study.

NOTE: This study is **not** about testing your published studies for fabrication.

We would like to invite you to participate in this study, where we request you to fabricate a dataset on the Stroop task and would like to interview you on how you fabricated the data. To compensate you for your time, you will receive 100 euro's at the end of the interview. You may earn an additional 100 euro's if your fabricated results prove to be one of the three that are hardest to detect (out of 20). Participation would entail fabricating a dataset before the face-to-face interview. The face-to-face interview will take approximately 45 minutes, fabricating the data will take at least 30 minutes but the time spent on fabricating data is at your discretion.

The data of our study will be used to examine the performance of statistical methods to detect fabricated data. This study has been approved by the Psychological Ethics Committee of Tilburg University (reference EC-2015.50).

Participation in this study requires the use of a PC, because we require you to use spreadsheets to process the fabricated data.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reply to this e-mail.

Kind regards from Tilburg University,
Chris Hartgerink
Jan Völkel
Marcel van Assen

# Consent form

## Consent to Participate in Research

### Description

If you choose to participate, you will take part in a study about "Validating statistical methods to detect (potential) data fabrication". If you participate, you will be asked to fabricate research results. 

### Benefits

You will receive 100 euro's at the end of the face-to-face interview, with a potential additional 100 euro's if your fabricated results are one of the three that are hardest to detect (out of 20). 

Your participation will help us investigate the performance of statistical methods to detect fabricated data. We focus on studying whether fabricated data can be detected in a valid manner (e.g., the power and the false positive rate), where the goal is to become better informed about the validity of these methods and whether these methods are valuable to apply in practice.

### Risks/discomforts

Fabricating the data will take at least 30 minutes, but how long you spend on it is at your discretion. The face-to-face interview will take approximately 45 minutes. There is a small risk that you may become uncomfortable during the study given the unethical nature of the behavior that we request you to perform in this controlled setting. If any feelings of discomfort emerge you are free to contact the lead investigator with any questions or concerns using the email address listed at the bottom of this consent form. This study has been approved by the Tilburg University Psychological Ethics Committee (reference EC-2015.50).

### Confidentiality

To ensure anonymity, we disabled the logging of your e-mail address or IP-address by Qualtrics when responding to the invitation. We are required by law to have receipts that the participant has received the reward. These receipts are temporarily linked to the responses in order to identify the participants who fabricated results that are hardest to detect (top three out of 20). These temporary links are permanently removed after the rewards are awarded. The unlinked and anonymous data from this study will be made publicly available at the Open Science Framework for as long as possible, such that other researchers can verify and reanalyze the data.

### Voluntary nature of participation

Your decision to participate in this study is completely voluntary. If you choose to participate, you may terminate your participation at any time.

### Contact information

In case you have any remaining concerns or questions about this survey, please feel free to e-mail the principal investigator Chris Hartgerink ([c.h.j.hartgerink@tilburguniversity.edu](mailto:c.h.j.hartgerink@tilburguniversity.edu)).

### Consent

If you are willing to participate in this study and if you agree with the anonymization and storage of the data, please confirm below and continue with the survey.
 
 - [ ]	I have read and understood the description and consent to participate in this study and agree with the outlined anonymization procedure and data storage, knowing that I can stop my participation at any time.


# Instructions

## Overview study

We require you to fabricate data for 25 participants in a Stroop task experiment. The goal is to fabricata that look as genuine as possible. The fabricated data must support the two hypotheses that we provide.
 
In the Stroop task, participants are asked to determine the color a word is presented in (i.e., word colors), but the word also reads a color (i.e., color words). The presented word color (i.e., 'red', 'blue', or 'green') can be either presented in the congruent color (e.g., 'red' presented in red) or an incongruent color (i.e., 'red' presented in green). The dependent variable in the Stroop task is the response latency. It is hypothesized that latency is on average higher for incongruent than for congruent words.

We require you to fabricate the mean and standard deviation of 25 (fictional) individuals their response latencies in both congruent and incongruent conditions (i.e., 25 individuals × 2 conditions × 2 statistics = 100 data points). Each participant sees 30 trials of the Stroop task in the congruent condition, and 30 trials in the incongruent condition.
<!-- Need to double check that number with ML3 -->

## Hypotheses

Below, a link is provided to a spreadsheet in which you have to fill out your fabricated summary statistics for the Stroop effect study. A pdf of the instructions provided here is also available to download.

Your task is to fabricate the mean and SD of the response latency (in milliseconds; i.e., 1 second = 1000 milliseconds) for congruent and incongruent conditions, for 25 (fictional) individuals (i.e., 2 conditions × 2 statistics × 25 persons = 100 data points).

After you fill out the highlighted yellow cells, the spreadsheet automatically calculates and displays the test statistics (t-values and p-values) concerning one hypothesis. How you decide to fabricate the results that you fill out in the spreadsheet is up to you. Your task is to fabricate means and standard deviations such that
 
1. There is an effect of condition, such that responses in the incongruent condition are slower than in the congruent condition.

2. There are no differences in the standard deviations of responses across conditions. [CHJH: Marcel, you want to see evidence of this in ML3 again I guess? :-)]

# Fabrication spreadsheet

See this [spreadsheet](https://github.com/chartgerink/2015ori/raw/master/materials/study_02/templateUNLOCKED.xlsx).

# Schedule a meeting

On the previous screen, we provided you with the materials to participate in this study. You can spend as much time as you think is needed on fabricating the data, until the interview actually takes place.

Now, we would like to request you to plan an interview with the research assistant Jan. In order to facilitate the planning of the interviews throughout the Netherlands and Belgium, we would like to ask you to suggest several options in his calendar via Doodle.com with the address where the interview would take place. 

Multiple suggestions are a necessity, given travel time has to be taken into account. In the case that the suggestions are not physically possible for Jan, he will contact you to try and reschedule. 

# Instructions on Doodle MeetMe page

Please suggest several dates on this page for the interview.

First, please mark your time-slot proposals in the calendar and click on "Create meeting request.

Multiple suggestions are necessary as multiple interviews conducted. In the case that none of your suggestions are possible, Jan will contact you to reschedule the interview.

Then, please indicate your address in the location field and follow the necessary steps to send the request.

# Step-by-step protocol for interview [Including full list of interview questions]

## Step 1: Introduction

Dear _________________,
First of all, on behalf of all researchers involved in this study, thank you very much for participating in our study. We highly appreciate the time and effort that you spent to create the fabricated dataset.
My name is Jan. I am a research assistant and I would like to conduct the interview with you today. The interview will take around 45 minutes and it will be semi structured. That is, I have prepared some questions to understand how you proceed to fabricate the data, but you are free to bring in the information you find most important and to focus on certain areas.
Before we begin with the actual interview, I would like to ask you to copy the spreadsheet with the fabricated data to this usb stick in the folder: Participant No. __________.

[Participants copies fabricated data to stick]

#### NOTE: We have to decide whether I give them the stick which I think is the easiest thing to do. But then we have to make sure that they cannot copy the data from other participants that might be on that stick.

Ok, thank you very much. Now, we come to the interview. In order to maximize the amount of information that we can use from the interview, I would like to record the interview. Are you ok with recording the video? Note that I will be the only person who can connect your interview data to the fabricated data file and we will delete any personally identifying information as soon as we have sent out the prices for the best fabricated data sets.

[Participants indicates that they are ok with recording the interview]

#### NOTE: Do we need another form which they sign to declare that they are fine with the recording? Or is the consent form on qualtrics enough.

#### NOTE: What do we do if they are not ok with recording the interview?
Alright, thank you. Then I would like to start with the interview now.

[Turn on Dictaphone]

## Step 2: Interview

In this interview, I will ask you open questions. Please feel free to elaborate as much as you want on every point that is important to you.

### Step 2a: Warm-up question? 

#### NOTE: I have read that one should ask some personal background questions first. But I am a bit hesitant to do this in the context of the actual interview. What do you think?

### Step 2b: Broad question
Please tell me how you fabricated your data set, beginning when you downloaded the instructions from the qualtrics page.

### Step 2c: Follow-up questions (If this was not already covered)

Part 1: Preparations
- Did you make a plan how you would fabricate the data?
- Did you spend some time informing yourself about methods to fabricate data?
	* [if yes] – what were your sources?

Part 2: Actually fabricating
- How did you fabricate your first data set?
- Did you apply a specific data fabrication strategy or did you experiment with whatever came to mind?
	* [if a specific strategy was used] Why did you choose for this specific strategy?
	* [if experimentation was used] What criteria did you use to determine if the data fabrication approach was successful 		in being difficult to be detected?
- Were there things you spent particular focus on during the data fabrication in order to make them look more genuine?
	* [if yes] what aspects did you spend particular attention to?
	* [if no] in hindsight, are there things you think you should have paid specific attention to?

Part 3: Test and retest – Improving the data set
- How did you test the quality of your data set?
- How many different datasets do you estimate that you fabricated before getting to the final, fabricated dataset?
- Did you take into consideration other relations than those in the hypotheses?
	* [if confused] For example, correlations between the means and the standard deviations?
- Are you familiar with statistical methods to detect data fabrication?
	* [if yes] can you describe or name the methods you are familiar with?
	* [if yes] did you use these methods and if so, how?

Part 4: Others
- How would you rate your knowledge of statistics? (1 = extremely poor; 10 = excellent)
- Which statistical analysis programs do you use at least once a week? [multiple answers possible]
	* SPSS        R        Stata        SAS        Matlab        Python        
	* Other, namely: _____________
	* None
- How many studies including a Stroop task have you conducted? [CHJH: Scrap? We pre-selected on this after all]
- How long do you estimate that it took you to fabricate the data?
- Besides the supplied spreadsheet, did you use any other programs to fabricate data?
	* [if yes] Did you use a random number generator to simulate data during this study?
	* [if no] Was there a specific reason why you did not use the computer in the data fabrication process?

Part 5: Final questions
- How do you rate the quality of your fabricated data set? (1 = extremely poor; 10 = excellent)
- How likely do you think is it that your fabricated data set can be detected by existing methods to detect data fabrication? (1 = very unlikely; 10 = very likely)
- Is there anything else you can recall about the data fabrication process that you think is worth mentioning?

Ok, then this is the end of the interview. 

[Turn off Dictaphone]

## Step 3: Post-Interview

I will now give you the 100 € for the participation. 

[Hand out 100 €]
[Hand out receipt]

Please read and sign this form to indicate that you have received the 100 €. Note that for the additional 100 € that you may receive, we first have to determine which dataset is hardest to detect. You will be informed in around _____ weeks whether you will receive the additional money.

[Participant signs receipt]

Thank you very much for participating in our study. As a final reminder, I have to emphasize that fabricating data is only allowed within this experiment and should not be taken as an invitation to fabricate research results elsewhere. Data fabrication is a serious form of scientific misconduct and is widely and explicitly condemned by professional organizations, institutions, and funding agencies alike.
If you have any questions about this project, you can ask them now. 

[Wait for questions by the participant]

#### NOTE: How should I deal with the situation when they have questions that I cannot answer? Give them Chris’ email address?

Ok, if you do not have [anymore] questions, thanks again for your participation! You will hear from us about the potential bonus treatment. Have a nice day!

# Step-by-step protocol for handing over data from Jan to Chris 

## Data
- Spreadsheet with fabricated data
- Interview recordings

## Tasks
- We have to be able to link spreadsheet and interview recordings
- We have to store the data
- All identifiable information have to be deleted

## Problems
- Do we want to store the initial recordings of the interviews or only the transcripts?
- We need the identifiable information so that we can send the 100€ to the winner

## Procedure

After Interview starting situation:
- 20 spreadsheets are on a USB stick
- 20 interview recordings are on the Dictaphone
- 20 receipts for 100 €

Step 1: Jan hands in receipts to HR office
- To whom exactly?

Step 2: Jan creates files
- Jan assigns Id to spreadsheets and to interview recordings so that they can be linked
- Jan creates a separate password-protected document in which ID and person + contact details are linked (Nobody else has access to this document)

Step 3: Jan ensures that all spreadsheet data is not identifiable
- Destroying metadata of files / Copying everything into new files (?)

Step 4: Jan sends spreadsheet data to Chris
- Jan uploads spreadsheet with ID to platform (github?) and shares it with Chris

Step 5: Jan transcribes interviews
- Jan uses automatic transcription software
- Jan double-checks and corrects results of transcription software

Step 6: Jan deletes raw interview data / uploads to secret password-protected platform (What do you want?)

Step 7: Jan sends transcripts to Chris
- Jan uploads transcripts to platform (github?) and shares it with Chris

Step 8: Chris determines winners of fabrication competition and sends Jan the respective IDs

Step 9: Jan identifies winners with help of the ID->name spreadsheet

Step 10: Jan brings price to winners and collects 3 receipts

Step 11: Jan hands in receipts to HR office
- To whom exactly?

Step 12: Jan deletes ID->name spreadsheet
