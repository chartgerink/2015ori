## Reminder Email

Dear fellow scientist,

This is a friendly reminder that we have invited you to participate in a study on the development and validation of statistical methods to detect data fabrication.

Note that we neither suspect you to have fabricated data nor do we want to test your past research. Rather, we are looking for scientists from Belgium and the Netherlands who have published on the Stroop task and want to participate in our study where we ask you to fabricate a new dataset on the Stroop task. Participation is compensated with 100 euros.

As such, participation would entail fabricating a dataset before the face-to-face interview. Fabricating the data will probably take at least 30 minutes; the face-to-face interview will take approximately 45 minutes.

You may earn an additional 100 euros if your fabricated results prove to be one of the three that are hardest to detect (out of 20).

The data of our study will only be used to examine the performance of statistical methods to detect fabricated data. No information is stored that may identify you personally, after the study is completed. Our study has been approved by the Psychological Ethics Committee of Tilburg University (reference EC-2015.50) and is funded by the Office of Research Integrity from the United States.

Participation in this study requires the use of a PC and a spreadsheet program such as Excel or OpenOffice, because we require you to use spreadsheets to process the fabricated data.
