Dear fellow scientist,

We are conducting a study on statistical methods to distinguish genuine psychological data from fabricated data. To this end, we are looking for scientists who have recently published in a psychology journal and want to participate in our study.
 
We would like to invite you to participate in this study, where we request you to fabricate data. To compensate you for your time, you will receive a $30 Amazon gift card upon completion of the study itself, with a potential additional $50 gift card if your fabricated results are one of the three that are hardest to detect. Participation takes 40 minutes on average but may vary a lot across participants (some take 10 minutes).

The data of our study will be used to examine the performance of methods to detect fabricated data. This study has been approved by the Psychological Ethics Committee of Tilburg University (reference EC-2015.50).

Participation in this study requires the use of a PC, because we require you to use spreadsheets to process the fabricated data. We do not store any personal data other than those you explicitly fill in during the study. Note that we do require your e-mail address to send you the gift card, if you wish to receive it. The e-mail addresses will be permanently unlinked from individual responses upon sending out the gift cards. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to reply to this e-mail.

Kind regards from Tilburg University,
Chris Hartgerink
