What are the characteristics that most stuck with you qualifying the interviews?
A. I think that data fakers can be divided into 3 intersecting* groups: 
	1. ppl who use existing data and slightly modify it
	2. ppl who simulate data
	3. ppl who make up data by hand
	*: Intersecting because people who use options 2 or 3 are still often inspired by real data or partly use real data during the fabrication process

B. I think ppl who are able to use R, Matlab etc. are more likely to use option 2 than options 1 or 3

C. I think ppl who are not able to use R cannot use option 2

D. I think just one or so said that they read literature about detecting fabricated data set. However, the average effort participants mentioned was not very low. It seems that participants do not want to spend so much time on reading, but rather doing.

E. I think most ppl did not have a checklist which they followed. Some people were quite advanced and had a lot of knowledge, but I think most people did not state that for instance there should be a within-subject correlation.

F. The criteria that ppl mentioned were quite different. Some focused on things like realistic values and ouliers, while others focused more on the relationship between the variables.

G. There was an interesting divide between people who found the task quite easy and people who found it very hard (I think the majority).

H. Data faking seems to be quite a psychological burden. Many ppl mentioned that they had a feeling that they missed something important.

I. My impression of the statistical knowledge of the participants (of course of limited validity due to my own limited statistical knowledge) did not seem to correlate much with the self-estimated knowledge of statistics.

J. Our instruction to estimate one's knowledge of statistics compared to the peers in their own field might make the rating more difficult to interpret. For instance, we had ppl from methods and statistics who rated themselves rather low although compared to the other participants they might perceive themselves as quite knowledgeable.

K. Our sample was very selective in the sense that most participants seemed to be in favor of the project.
