My general strategy was to think about what population distributions the data might come from if the hypothesis were true, and then randomly generate numbers from those distributions. /  / For all studies, I began by speculating what number people's guesses would center around per condition, and I tried to create distributions around those numbers. /  / I haven't run anchoring studies, but I figured that responses would be slightly skewed away from the anchor. For the first three studies, I used beta distributions that were skewed accordingly. For the last one (distance from NY to SF), I used normal distributions because the range of plausible values seemed so small. In retrospect, this might have been based on my knowledge of the two conditions, and not representative of how subjects would actually think without that knowledge. /  / For the first three studies, I started by plotting the densities of random beta distributions. I multiplied the randomly generated values by a number that made the distributions as variable as I thought was reasonable and added a number to center the distributions around the value I thought people would center on. For example, for the height of mount everest I used plot(density(rbeta(10000, 3, 10)*10000+5000)) in the low anchor condition. For the last study, I generated normal distributions that looked plausible when I plotted the densities.  /  / Next, for the first three studies I randomly sampled 64 men and 64 women per condition from the distributions I came up with for the low and high anchor conditions. The parameters for men and women were the same within each study. /  / For the fourth study, I realized that you might try to look at the data across studies to look for signs of something fishy. My values for men and women were too similar, so I made slight changes to the population parameters for men and women (both the means and standard deviations) so that the results would like a little more variable. In retrospect, I might try to make slight variations in the parameters for men and women across studies if I were to do it again. /  / This was a fun study, I look forward to seeing the results. /  / After finding probability densities that looked good, I generated random samples of 64 men and 64 women per distribution, and used those to compute the means and standard deviations.
