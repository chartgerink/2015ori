1. Still pending ethics approval (revision submitted)
2. Collection of emails for study 1 done. 
3. Used following procedure: Web of science --> 2015 only (1,431,893) --> psychology only ("Web of Science categories"; 8,212 results) --> only articles ("Document Types"; 4,876 results) --> USA only ("Countries/Territories"; 2,014 results) --> use Selenium to navigate through all items and select them --> download marked list per 500 (somehow this gives 2,018...?) --> extract corresponding author email --> retain only unique emails (2 ,038 emails, possible due to multiple emails in one result!)
4. Collection of emails for study 2 done
5. Used following procedure: Web of science --> 2005-2015 and topic "Stroop" (4,941 results) --> psychology only ("Web of Science categories"; 815 results) --> only articles ("Document Types"; 720 results) --> Netherlands + Belgium only ("Countries/Territories"; 86 results) --> download marked list --> extract corresponding author email --> retain only unique emails (92, possible due to multiple emails in one result!)

1. still awaiting ethics approval
2. Mailed with Marcel. Higher order correlation test will be based on true data from ML3, from which a distribution of correlations is computed and can be used to compare observed correlation with.

# November 8, 2015
1. Got ethics approval recently (November 2, 2015)
2. Meet with Marcel and Jelte today on more
3. Control question: where are you from originally (us/non-us)?

1. some notes from Jan
>One idea that I developed while doing the transcribing was to have different check programs for the 3 types of fabrication. As an example:
>1. For fakers who use existing data sets and just slightly change this existing data set, one could check for similarties using all publicly available data sets. 
>2. For fakers who do the simulation, one could check for residuals or deviations from a perfect distribition
>3. For fakers who do it by hand, one could check for regularities like that sequences with number going all up or all down appear more often.
